# Call for Proposals: SBOL Industrial 2022 Summer Program

The SBOL Industrial Consortium is sponsoring summer projects related to SBOL, with the goal of advancing state-of-the-art technology in the fields of synthetic biology and bio-design automation through SBOL standards and associated tool development. While any project within this scope will be considered, SBOL Industrial is particularly interested in projects that provide:

- User-friendly methods for defining and encoding variant libraries
- Improved integration of SBOL with commercial design tools
- Improved visualization of SBOL information
-	Integrations that overcome specific impediments to industrial applications

Additional project suggestions can be found on [in the issue tracker for this project](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-Industrial-Summer-Program/issues).

Project proposals are welcomed from any individual with the appropriate skills and expertise to conduct the work proposed. All projects must be supervised by a technical advisor with relevant expertise, either industrial or academic. Each project will also be assigned a liaison from the SBOL Industrial community.

Complete call and form for response are located [here](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-Industrial-Summer-Program/blob/main/proposal-template.md).
