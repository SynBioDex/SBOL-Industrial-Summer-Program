**Note**:  
While any project within this scope will be considered, SBOL Industrial is particularly interested in projects that provide:
- User-friendly methods for defining and encoding variant libraries
- Improved integration of SBOL with commercial design tools
- Better visualization of SBOL designs (e.g., combinatorial libraries, zooming in and out) - Integrations that overcome specific impediments to industrial applications*

Project proposals are welcomed from any individual with the appropriate skills and expertise to conduct the work proposed. All projects must be supervised by a technical advisor with relevant expertise, either industrial or academic. Each project will also be assigned a liaison from the SBOL Industrial community.

Projects are intended for a 3 month summer period with compensation of $6,000 (US), though smaller-scale projects are acceptable as well. Proposals are due by **February 15th, 2021**, following the forms below, and will be notified of acceptance or rejection by March 15th, 2021.
